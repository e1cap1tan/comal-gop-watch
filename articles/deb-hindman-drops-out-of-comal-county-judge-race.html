            <p>COMAL COUNTY, TX — Deb Hindman has withdrawn from the Republican primary race for Comal County Judge, leaving Kristen Hoyt and Kayne Parrish as the remaining candidates competing for the position. The withdrawal was announced by her husband during a community meeting about the controversial Broken Cedar Ranch development on Nextdoor, a neighborhood social networking platform.</p>

<p>Hindman's unexpected exit from the race comes just weeks before early voting begins on February 17, potentially disrupting plans for voters who had intended to support her candidacy. Her withdrawal narrows what had been a three-candidate Republican primary to a two-person contest between Hoyt, a local attorney with extensive courtroom experience, and Parrish, a business owner and former law enforcement officer.</p>

<p>The timing of Hindman's announcement during a Nextdoor discussion about the Broken Cedar Ranch wastewater treatment facility has sparked speculation about her motivations, though no official statement has been released by her campaign. The development project has become a contentious issue in local politics, with environmental concerns and infrastructure capacity driving heated community debate.</p>

<p>Both remaining candidates bring distinct professional backgrounds to the race. Kristen Hoyt has positioned herself as a candidate with deep legal expertise and courtroom experience, emphasizing her understanding of judicial processes and county governance. Kayne Parrish, meanwhile, has highlighted his business acumen and law enforcement background, promising to bring practical problem-solving skills to the county judge role.</p>

<p>The County Judge position carries significant responsibilities beyond the courtroom, including overseeing county operations, managing budgets, and serving as the administrative head of Commissioners Court. With rapid population growth and development pressures facing Comal County, both candidates will need to address complex issues ranging from infrastructure planning to environmental protection.</p>

<p>Hindman's withdrawal also raises questions about the election process, as her name will still appear on printed ballots despite her exit from the race. Voters who cast ballots for Hindman will effectively waste their vote, making it crucial for her former supporters to choose between the two remaining candidates.</p>

<p>For Hoyt and Parrish, Hindman's departure represents both an opportunity and a challenge. Each will now compete for her potential voter base while continuing to differentiate themselves from their opponent. The narrowed field may lead to a more focused campaign discussion on the key issues facing Comal County.</p>

<p>Early voting begins February 17, with the primary election scheduled for March 3. The Republican primary winner will face any Democratic candidates in the November general election, though the position has traditionally been heavily contested within the Republican primary in this conservative county.</p>
