            <p>In the race for New Braunfels mayor, candidate Angela Allen has come under fire after blocking local activist Joeylynn Mesaros on social media. The incident occurred when Mesaros attempted to ask Allen about her position on potential mosque development plans in the city. According to Mesaros, she posed what she described as "basic questions" regarding Allen's stance on the approval process for religious facilities, only to find herself abruptly blocked from Allen's public accounts. This action has sparked a broader discussion about transparency and accessibility in the mayoral campaign.</p>

<p>The controversy centers on rumors of a proposed mosque development in New Braunfels, a topic that has stirred debate among residents. While no official plans have been confirmed by the city or local religious organizations, the issue of religious facility approvals often raises questions about zoning laws, community impact, and cultural integration in Comal County. Mesaros, a vocal advocate for community engagement, stated that her intent was to clarify Allen's views on how such projects would be handled under her potential leadership. "I wasn't attacking her; I just wanted answers," Mesaros said in a statement to the <em>Hill Country Sentinel</em>.</p>

<p>Allen's decision to block Mesaros has drawn criticism from some community members who argue that candidates for public office should remain open to questions, especially on sensitive topics. "If you're running for mayor, you can't just shut down conversation," said local resident Mark Hernandez. "Transparency matters, especially on issues that affect our town's future." Others, however, defend Allen's right to manage her social media presence, noting that online platforms can become contentious spaces. "Candidates aren't obligated to engage with every comment or question, especially if they feel it's hostile," countered Sarah Kline, a supporter of Allen's campaign.</p>

<p>Allen has not yet issued a public statement regarding the incident or her specific views on religious facility development. Her campaign website emphasizes a commitment to "inclusive growth" and "community-driven decision-making," but lacks detailed policy positions on zoning or cultural projects. The <em>Hill Country Sentinel</em> reached out to Allen's campaign for comment but has not received a response as of press time. Meanwhile, the lack of clarity on her stance continues to fuel speculation and concern among voters.</p>

<p>The broader issue of religious freedom and development remains a delicate one in New Braunfels, a city with a strong sense of heritage and a growing, diverse population. Past discussions on similar projects have highlighted tensions between preserving local identity and accommodating new communities. With the mayoral election approaching, candidates' approaches to such matters are likely to influence voter sentiment, particularly among those who prioritize either cultural preservation or progressive inclusion.</p>

<p>This incident also raises questions about the role of social media in modern campaigning. While platforms like Facebook and Twitter allow candidates to connect directly with constituents, they also create challenges in managing public perception and handling criticism. For now, the Allen-Mesaros conflict serves as a reminder of the delicate balance between accessibility and personal boundaries in the digital age, a balance that New Braunfels voters will likely consider as they head to the polls.</p>
