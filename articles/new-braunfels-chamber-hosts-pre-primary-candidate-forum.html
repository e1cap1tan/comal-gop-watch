            <p>The Greater New Braunfels Chamber of Commerce is set to host a pre-primary candidate forum, offering Comal County voters a chance to hear directly from candidates in several key local races. Scheduled just ahead of the start of early voting on February 17, the event aims to inform residents before they head to the polls for the March 3 primary election. The forum will provide a platform for candidates to address pressing issues facing the community, from infrastructure to economic development.</p>

<p>This year's primary ballot features multiple contested races that are drawing significant attention in Comal County. Among them are races for county commissioner seats, state legislative positions, and other local offices that will shape the region's future. With rapid growth continuing to impact New Braunfels and surrounding areas, candidates are expected to focus on topics like traffic congestion, property taxes, and water resource management—issues that resonate deeply with local voters.</p>

<p>The Chamber's decision to host the forum underscores the growing engagement of the business community in local elections. As a key economic driver in the region, the Greater New Braunfels Chamber of Commerce has increasingly sought to foster dialogue between candidates and constituents, ensuring that business interests and community needs are addressed. "We want to create an informed electorate that understands the positions of those running for office," said a Chamber spokesperson. "This forum is about connecting voters with the people who will represent them."</p>

<p>The event is open to the public and will be held at a yet-to-be-announced venue in New Braunfels, with details to be shared on the Chamber's website. Organizers encourage attendees to come prepared with questions for the candidates, emphasizing the interactive nature of the forum. With early voting just days away, the timing of the event is critical for undecided voters seeking clarity on where candidates stand.</p>

<p>Comal County has seen a surge in voter interest in recent years, driven by the area's population boom and the accompanying challenges of growth. Events like the Chamber's candidate forum play a vital role in maintaining transparency and accountability in local government. As the primary election approaches, such opportunities for direct engagement could influence turnout and shape the outcomes of these competitive races.</p>

<p>For those unable to attend, the Chamber is exploring options to stream the forum online or provide a recorded version, ensuring broader access to the candidates' platforms. With the political landscape in Comal County evolving, the business community's active role in facilitating these discussions signals a commitment to civic participation and informed decision-making.</p>
