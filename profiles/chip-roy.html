            <h2>Biography</h2>
            <p>Charles Eugene "Chip" Roy was born August 7, 1972, in Bethesda, Maryland, and raised in Virginia. He is a devoted husband and father of two currently serving his fourth term in Congress representing Texas's 21st Congressional District, which includes South Austin, North San Antonio, and the Texas Hill Country.</p>
            
            <p>Roy holds a B.S. and M.A. from the University of Virginia and a J.D. from the University of Texas School of Law. Before his election to Congress, he had an extensive career in public service and the private sector. He served as First Assistant Attorney General of Texas under Ken Paxton, Chief of Staff to Senator Ted Cruz, senior advisor to Texas Governor Rick Perry, Senate Judiciary Committee staff director under Senator John Cornyn, and as a federal prosecutor. Prior to entering public service, he worked for nearly three years as an investment banking analyst.</p>

            <p>Roy first won election to Congress in 2018 and has been re-elected three times, most recently in 2024 with 61.9% of the vote against Democratic challenger Kristin Hook.</p>

            <h2>2026 Texas Attorney General Campaign</h2>
            <p>On August 21, 2025, Representative Roy announced that he will run for Texas Attorney General in 2026 rather than seek re-election to the U.S. House of Representatives. This decision comes as incumbent Attorney General Ken Paxton is running for the U.S. Senate.</p>
            
            <p>In his campaign announcement, Roy emphasized his extensive record defending Texas against federal overreach and border security issues. "My record runs deep, defending Texans against open borders here from Texas and from Washington D.C.," Roy stated. "Without question, without apology, and without excuse, I stand ready as Attorney General to defend Texans against a world of people that want to illegally cross our borders."</p>

            <p>Roy's decision to run for Attorney General creates an open seat in Texas's 21st Congressional District, a deep red district that has been reliably Republican.</p>
