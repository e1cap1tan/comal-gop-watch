            <p>COMAL COUNTY, TX — Three candidates have entered the Republican primary race for Comal County Commissioner Precinct 2, setting up a competitive contest as early voting approaches. Incumbent Sarah Martinez faces challenges from local business owner Tom Rodriguez and former school board member Jennifer Walsh in what promises to be one of the more closely watched races on the March 5 ballot.</p>

<p>Martinez, seeking her second term after winning the seat in 2022, has focused heavily on infrastructure improvements during her tenure, overseeing road maintenance projects and water system upgrades throughout Precinct 2. Her campaign emphasizes continuity and experience, highlighting her relationships with county staff and understanding of ongoing projects that require sustained attention.</p>

<p>Challenger Tom Rodriguez brings private sector experience from his construction company, arguing that business-world efficiency can improve county operations. Rodriguez has criticized what he calls bureaucratic delays in permitting and project completion, promising streamlined processes that would reduce costs for taxpayers while maintaining quality standards.</p>

<p>Jennifer Walsh, who served on the Comal Independent School District board for six years, offers a different perspective rooted in education and community engagement. Walsh has emphasized transparency and public involvement in decision-making, proposing regular town halls and improved communication between commissioners and constituents.</p>

<p>The race comes at a crucial time for Comal County, which continues to experience rapid population growth and development pressures. Precinct 2, covering significant portions of the county's eastern areas, includes both established neighborhoods and new developments, creating complex needs that the next commissioner will need to address.</p>

<p>Road maintenance has emerged as a central issue, with all three candidates acknowledging the backlog of repairs needed across the precinct. However, they differ on approach: Martinez advocates for gradual, systematic improvements; Rodriguez proposes accelerated timelines through improved contractor management; and Walsh emphasizes community input in prioritizing which roads receive attention first.</p>

<p>Water infrastructure represents another key concern, particularly as new developments strain existing systems. The candidates have varying perspectives on how aggressively the county should require developers to fund infrastructure improvements versus using county resources to maintain and expand capacity.</p>

<p>Early voting begins February 14, giving voters nearly three weeks to evaluate the candidates before the March 5 primary. The Republican primary winner will likely face minimal opposition in the November general election, making this contest crucial for determining Precinct 2's representation for the next four years.</p>

<p>All three candidates have committed to participating in forums hosted by local organizations, including the Greater New Braunfels Chamber of Commerce and various neighborhood associations. These events will provide voters with opportunities to hear directly from the candidates about their priorities and approaches to county governance.</p>
